## Introduction
Cypher Playground is a tool to access a remote Neo4j Graph database. After receiving query from the user (React, Node.js), it checks the query (C++), sends to the remote server (GO), executes it and gives back the response in JSON format. The system also provides two kinds of visulaizer (OCaml, Smalltalk) that display the result in a more readable way.

* client - client application that has API for sending
  queries/requests to server
  * Frontend: Web page that receives Cypher queries
  * Backen: Validate the query and send request to server

* server - server dealing with requests and manipulating db

* database - graph database

* visualizer - (in a way part of the client) to visualize the result
